    <h2>A beginers guide to the world of scuba diving</h2>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>As someone who has always had an interest in scuba diving, I found it difficult to find a good source of information on what it takes to become a certified scuba diver, and what to do once you have become certified. To make this process easier others, I have made this guide</p>

      <p>This step may be the most important as it is where you learn the most. It will begin with a class portion where you will learn
         the <a href="https://www.scubadiving.com/training/basic-skills/10-new-rules-scuba-diving">basic rules and information</a>
         you need to be able to scuba dive. They will also tell you the dangers of scuba diving and how to deal with or avoid them.
          You will then be tested on all you have learned on a written test to make sure you are ready for the practical part of the class.</p> 
      <p>The practical part of the class first takes place in the pool. The dive shop you with whom you choose to take your classes, will likely include 
         your scuba gear rental in their total class cost. In the pool you will put into practice all the safety procedures you have learned. 
         Please note: You will have to be able to tread water for an extended period of time, so keep your physical fitness in mind.</p>
      <p>Once your instructor is satisfied that everyone is now familiar with the gear and is comfortable in the water you will begin your
         open water dives. These are normally four dives in total on two separate days and two separate locations. Here the instructors will
          once again test you on the procedures you were taught in class and in the pool, only this time you will be in open water, which can 
          have a dramatic effect. My first open water dive was on a choppy day in New England water which meant visiblity was around three feet. 
          This can be very disconcerting to people who are not extremely comfortable in the water.</p>
      <p>If you are able to pass all these tests you will then be issued a padi certification card making you a fully licensed scuba diver.</p>

        <h5>Regulator</h5>
      </div>
      
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_regulator">regulator</a> is one of the most important pieces of gear you will buy.
      It is responsible for delivering air from your tank to your mouth piece and is therefore directly responsible for your breathing and filling your BCD. When 
      purchased it will come with two mouth pieces (One for main usage, and a spare for emergencies) and likely a dive computer though much of the time this can be swapped out.
      As this is a vital part of any divers gear, I would not skimp on the quality of the one you choose to purchase, it is worth the cost.
      Regulators will also have to be inspected periodically by professionals to ensure it is in good working order.</p>
      
      <!--Second Section: BCD-->
      
      
      <div class="center">

        <h6>BCD</h6>
      </div>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buoyancy_compensator_(diving)">BCD</a> or "buoyancy control device" is another necessary part of your scuba gear. This along with lead weights is how you control where you float up and down. Filling it with
        air from your tank allows you float more, while releasing the air stored inside will allow you to sink. With enough practice you will eventually be able to become neutrally buoyant 
        which means you will stay in one place under water as long as you aren't swimming. This is a relatively simple device consiting of a waterproof bladder within a vest. As such this will
        generally not be your most expensive piece of equipment.

      <!--Third section: Scuba tank -->
      
      
      <div class="center">

        <h7 >Tank</h7>
      </div>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diving_cylinder">Tanks</a> are another rather simple piece of equipment, though they are very important. They range drastically in many forms. Different tanks are capable of storing different amounts of air 
        at different pressures, and the one you will want to choose will be very particular to your interests. Scuba tanks come in two different valve configurations so it is important to note which 
        type of valve (yoke or din) your regulator has, and match that to your tank. There are also tanks that hold <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrox">nitrox</a>, a more oxygen rich gas than the regular air which normal tanks hold.
        these can only be used for nitrox diving for which you must have taken a special class. Without a licence you will not be able to fill your scuba tanks at any dive shops. Tanks also require 
        periodic testing called hydrostatic testing to ensure they can withstand the normal opperating pressures the tank will commonly be under.

      </div>
      <div class="inboxhead">
        <h8 >Mask, Fins, and Snorkel</h8>
      </div>
      <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snorkeling">Mask, fins, and snorkel</a> will be very personalized as there are so many options. Scuba diving fins are generally longer than snorkeling fins and shorter than freediving fins.
        The two main types are open heel and closed heel. The open heel design is more common as they require you to wear separate boots that fit into the fins. This is a valuable characteristic for shore divers who wade into the 
        water first with the boots to protect their feet from coral and other potentially harmful things on the ocean floor, and then put the fins on when they are in deep enough water. The closed style fins go directly on the
        feet and therefore offer no added protection when taken off. Masks and snorkels do not differ very much in functionality, but come in many different styles and colors for the customer to choose from.

      </div>
      <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dive_computer">Dive Computers</a> are where you could spend a lot of your money. These range from the very simple designs to the extremely complex. For the purposes of a beginner there is not much that you need in a dive computer.
        The more simple designs have a console showing the pressure left in the tank, your current depth, and may also include a dive clock to show how long you have been under. As a beginning diver you likely won't be exceeding 
        depths of 60ft and therefore will not need your dive computer to notify you of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decompression_practice">safety stops</a>, though it may give you this information as well. It is always a good idea to not rely on your computer completely and try to have a 
        general idea of the information it shows without having to look, though this is a skill you will gain with experience. </p>

    <div class="stephead">
      <h10 id="plan">Step 3: Plan a Dive</h10>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
      <p>There are many things to consider when planning a dive. First of all you should always dive with a buddy or in a group. A number of different things can go wrong on a dive, and having someone there to help you if you need it could save your life.
          Once you have your dive group you then need to consider where you want to dive. Deciding this is difficult as you need to take into account many different factors. You need to consider the experience and skill level of every diver in the group,
          and make sure no one is diving deeper than they are used to. If you are leading the dive you have to constantly be watching your depth and that of those around you. Communication can also a problem while diving. Divers communicate with hand signals
         so it's important that everone knows and agrees upon what the signals mean and when to give them. You also need to consider where and how you are entering the water. You can dive from shore or from a boat, both have their pros and cons but generally 
          diving from a boat is the easiest. Weather conditions play a huge role in diving. Wind and waves are not a problem when you are under the water but can make starting the dive from land nearly impossible. In places like New England where visibility is generally low,
         high winds and waves can stir up the water even more, and reduce visibility to almost nothing. Don't be afraid to cancel a dive trip due to bad weather. It can be a pain to reschedule, but the benefit of keeping everyone safe and togther far outweighs the cost. 
        </p>
      <p>Purchasing a dive trip is much less work on your behalf, and can be much more enjoyable. Dive trips almost always come with a guide who knows the area, and can show you the best spots to dive. Your guide will also look after you to make sure everyone is safe, and enjoying themselves.
        In general buying a dive trip is much less work and will allow you to see the best sights of the area, especially if you are not familiar with the dive site.
